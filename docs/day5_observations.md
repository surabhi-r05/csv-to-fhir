# ðŸ“Š Day 5 â€“ Observations Analysis

## Overview
This section analyzes key patient **vital signs** â€” including **Weight, BMI, Height, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Respiratory Rate,** and **Temperature** â€” based on the latest available measurements per patient.

We compute summary statistics such as **mean**, **median**, **standard deviation**, **percentiles (p10â€“p90)**, and **coverage (% of patients with recorded vitals)**.  
Additionally, we explore relationships between **BMI and Blood Pressure** and visualize inter-vital correlations.

## ðŸ’¡ Insights
- **Coverage:** Nearly all patients have complete BP, HR, and Weight data (>95%), while Temperature is recorded for ~49% of the cohort.  
- **BMI Distribution:** Average BMI ~26.4 indicates a slightly overweight population.  
- **Blood Pressure:** Mean BP (121/81 mmHg) is within normal range, but tails (p90) suggest a subset with elevated BP.  
- **Heart Rate & Respiratory Rate:** Both fall within normal physiological limits, confirming data consistency.  
- **Correlations:** BMI shows a positive trend with both systolic and diastolic BP, aligning with clinical expectations.
